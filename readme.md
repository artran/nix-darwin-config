# Nix Darwin Config

My configuration for a Mac used as a development workstation.

It's inspired by and based on [this repo](https://github.com/zmre/mac-nix-simple-example)
and the YouTube video that goes with it.

## Aims

I want the following features:

- Alacritty terminal
- ZSH with OhMyZSH and Starship
- Tmux with Powerline
- Neovim with customisation for development
- Rust
- Suitable NerdFonts
